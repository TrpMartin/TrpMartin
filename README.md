Hi, Iâ€™m @TrpMartin and yes, I also play the trumpet.ðŸŽº But I code for fun in my spare time with raspberry pi.
I build a cigar humidor and log my greenhouse temperature and humidity on thingspeak https://thingspeak.com/channels/774384 
Currently, I learn python3 and try myself with website scraping for exchange stock news.
